# Logistic Regression (Heart Disease Data)
In this repository we carry out some basic EDA on the Heart Disease data set from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci

We then move on to building our own logistic regression algorithm including: coding the gradient descent process and coding a ROC curve to analyze model performance for different probability thresholds.
